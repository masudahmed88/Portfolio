# Portfolio

I add a flex container on the navigation.

Added a linkedin picture in the About me. 

Added a link in the image of the first project i did in class.

Added a css variable to manipulate the background color. 

Added a flexbox within the navigation. 

Added media queries to make portfolio responsive. 
Still need to touch this section up. I need to fix up some the responsive measures within the application. 

EDIT ON 8/26/2021
Added project one into my work section.
